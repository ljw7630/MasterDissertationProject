            I understand that my participation in this experiment will involve interacting with a web application and will involve
            data generation from LinkedIn.com public personal and company profiles. Within this experiment I may spend as much or as
            little time extracting data as I wish. I understand I will not be identifiable from the data collected; users are
            identified using unique IDs.

            I understand that participation in this experiment is entirely voluntary.

            time destroyed, or to discuss my concerns with the experimenter.

            I understand that the timing of experiment, time used interacting with the system will be recorded anonymously
            throughout the experiment. These usage statistics will be made anonymous and it will be impossible to trace the material
            back to me.

            I understand that in the extremely unlikely event that I discuss any illicit activities, we will be obliged to pass that
            information on to appropriate authorities.
